# Finger_detection_algorithm
Uses OpenCV and concept of Convex Hull to detect fingers and display the count .
Concepts Used :
1. Contour Detection
2. Threshold Evaluation
3. Conncept of Convex Hull
4. Objection Detection 
5. Object Tracking 

Code for all the above concepts are added to get better clarity about the project .
HandDetection.py contains the final code for finger detection
Video Footage and Screenshots to show the actual functionality of the code is also added.
